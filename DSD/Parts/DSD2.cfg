	description = By using extraordinarily high-density science equipment and folding solutions, this lab compresses an astonishing amount of tools into a very small space. Working conditions are suitable for up to four Kerbal scientists, and advanced equipment allows scientists to be more productive than any other lab. Best used fully crewed.
